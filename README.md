# HackaCode 

### Team Name: Debug Thugs
### Project Name: Udaan

### Tagline:  Connect with NGOs, get help, source volunteers


### Problem it solves: 
It is no cost solution for NGOs to create a online presence, connect and chat with and manage volunteers and showcase their activities in a clean clutter-free manner. People who wish to connect and support NGOs that identify with their cause can join them in their activities. Other organizations and individual who need assistance can connect to groups and individuals who can help them in their needs. Our website acts like a platform to connect all the shareholders involved in the social work ecosystem. Website visitors can watch the website feed and browse through the activities of NGOs.

### Difficulties faced:
- It was difficult to integrate chatroom functionality with the website, with individual chatrooms for each NGO to connect and chat with the volunteers associated with them.

### Technologies used:
- expressjs
- nodejs
- socket.io
- mongodb
- google drive
